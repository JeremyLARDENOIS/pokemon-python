<h2 align="center">A simple, online, round-by-round combat platform.</h2>

---
## Simple functionality

You can use `server.py` to create a server and `client.py` to join an existing server.

## What's the purpose?

This project was initially a project I made to enter into an Engineer school, and it worked!

It's based on Pokemon and the game of Roshambo (AKA Rock-Paper-Scissors or Shi-Fu-Mi), where each attack does damage based on the attack of the opponent.

## To Do

- Verify functionality on Windows and MacOS
- Create a `Tkinter` interface
- Create a system of levelling
- Create a system of Player-versus-AI
- Make sure that `server.py` doesn't crash if clients crash
- Send a message to one client if the other crashes
- Create a loop to re-ask for a response if the client's input is invalid, or if they take too long to answer
- Upgrade network protocol or use another library/framework
- Make a multi-platform server (several combat instances at the same time)
- Make a class for players
- Alert the client if the server crashes
- Record the user's network protocol
